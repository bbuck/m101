# Information

This is just a project for me to share my work among the mayny computers I work from. This Repo
is **temporary** and will be **removed** a few weeks after the course so if (for whatever reason) you
find yourself keeping track of this repo and it dissapears, that's why.

In the mean time, feel free to fork, pull request (for whatever reason) or tell me how bad my python 
coding is! Just enjoy.

# Course

The course this is for can be found [here](http://education.10gen.com).
